Various notes about how to do things in git. This mostly contains things that
I don't do that often so don't have memorized and end up having to look for
it again. Links the git manuals:

* https://git-scm.com/docs[git Reference] - command line command referance.
* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[git book] - The pro git book that is kept up
    to date with the latest git release.

== Git Config

reference page: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config[git config]

=== set email

[source,sh]
.Email address for every repository on your computer
----
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
----

[source,sh]
.Email address for active repo
----
git config user.email "your_email@example.com"
----

[source,sh]
.github private email address
----
git config user.email "username@users.noreply.githup.com"
----


== Changing upstream URL

reference page: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote[git remote]

Find what the current remote URL(s) are defined as:
[source,sh]
----
git remote -v
----

Now using the list you can change any of them. For instance to change a https
url to ssh do:
[source,sh]
----
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:rdjack21/Notes.git
----
