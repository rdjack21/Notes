Various notes about how to do things in git. This mostly contains things that
I don't do that often so don't have memorized and end up having to look for
it again.

== Changing upstream URL

For full details of this see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote[git-remote]

Find what the current remote URL(s) are defined as:
[source,sh]
----
git remote -v
----

Now using the list you can change any of them. For instance to change a https
url to ssh do:
[source,sh]
----
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:rdjack21/Notes.git
----
