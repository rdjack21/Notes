This repo is just here to hold verious notes, cheat sheets and such. Every thing
here will be formated in AsciiDoc format.

The intent of these documents is that you render them using your preferred style sheet
then either host them on your server or just load them off your local file system. The
style sheet github uses are not very good nor do all the asciidoc options work. 

I have posted a rendered version of the AsciiDoc files on my pages site. You can
see the one and only doc I have so far
https://rdjack21.github.io/Notes/emacs-cheat-sheet.html[Here]. As start to really
update this I will on this read me and make it much better but for now this will do.
