This repo is just here to hold various notes, cheat sheets and such that I find
useful. 

All the documents are AsciiDoc formatted with some embedded Asciidoctor directives.
I have not tested these docs with the original python AsciiDoc tools I have only tested
with the Asciidoctor tool set which is the same tool set GitHub is using.

The official Asciidoctor web site is located http://asciidoctor.org/[here] where you
can find instructions on how to use Asciidoctor.

While github does support AsciiDoc the css style sheet they are using looks to be designed
to make AsciiDoc look like markdown which was supported first. While there is nothing
wrong with that it does limit what you can do and how good you can make the output
look on the normal project web site. The best way to view these documents is in the
projects pages space which I link to below.

== Rendered docs
These documents have been generated using the '`riak`' style sheet provided by the
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory[asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory] project.

* https://rdjack21.github.io/Notes/README.html[README] - This document just for the
heck of it. 
* https://rdjack21.github.io/Notes/emacs-cheat-sheet.html[emacs-cheat-sheet] - This is
just a standard Emacs cheat sheet covering the default keys.
* https://rdjack21.github.io/Notes/emacs_notes.html[emacs_notes] - This one contains
notes about the various packages I have installed into my instance of Emacs. This
just lets me put notes about my setup in one place without having to bounce all over
the place to find what I need. 

== How to generate HTML from these docs

1. You will need to have Asciidoctor installed and functioning. You can find
instructions on how to that http://asciidoctor.org/[**here**].
2. Clone this repo.
3. From a command prompt in the directory that you cloned this repo into execute
this command:
====
asciidoctor emacs-cheat-sheet.adoc
====

== Change the style sheet used to render the document
If you don't like the default style sheet I have set for rendering the document
you can change it in 2 different ways.

1. Change the `stylesheet` attribute at the top of the document to the style
sheet you would prefer to use then generate the html file.

2. You can override the style sheet used on the command line for example like
this:
====
asciidoctor -a stylesheet=golo.css emacs-cheat-sheet.adoc
====

To make this easier on you I have already included all the themes supported by the
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory[asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory]
project. The style sheets are in the '`css`' directory and any image resources they
may need are in the '`images`' directory.

If you wish to use a style sheet that I have not included you will also have to override
or change the style sheet location option either in the doc or the command line.

== Hey I like your doc and what to use it!
That is pretty easy to do and you have a few options.

1. If you like the style sheet I'm using you can just clone my pages project which already
has them rendered. They are in the '`Notes`' directory. Then just copy the files you want to
your server or just open them in your browser directly from your file system. When copying
them to a file server make sure and copy the '`css`' and '`images`' directories as well.

2. If you really don't want to copy all the css files to your server you can remove the
`linkcss` attribute from the top of the '`adoc`' file that you want a copy of then
regenerate it. This will cause the css to be embedded into the file. But this will not
cause any image resources to be embedded so you will still need to copy those over.
